# CODER'S CORNER USER MANUAL
**Program Description:**
This is a program developed to simulate a person ordering food at a restaurant. It includes various food choices that can be ordered, with some having extra personalization options. There is a simple menu that dispays the foods, however a detailed menu can also be accessed with all the extra options. A list of what you have ordered is kept track of in a text file, with your receipt being printed to another text file once you have completed your order. Once an order is completed, you can tip if you want to, note, this tip amount won't be included in the receipt.
